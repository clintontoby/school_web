            <p id="part1">


                The ICT Unit, established during the 2015/2016 academic session, serves as a cornerstone of
                technological advancement at our university. Initially led by a single staff member, the unit has grown
                in tandem with the institution's evolving needs and aspirations. <br>


                <br> In its infancy, the ICT Unit managed foundational elements such as the university website, internet
                access, and an internal telephone system (PABX). Recognizing the importance of keeping pace with
                technological advancements, the unit embarked on a transformative project in the 2017/2018 academic
                year: the development of a University Portal. This portal revolutionized crucial processes like
                admissions and result processing, offering efficiency and accessibility to students, faculty, and
                administrative staff alike. Through collaborative efforts with external consultants, the ICT Unit
                successfully implemented and has since maintained the portal through numerous upgrades, ensuring its
                continued relevance and functionality. <br>

                <br> In 2019, leadership of the ICT Unit transitioned to a new director, ushering in a period of
                innovation
                and growth. Under successive leaderships, the unit has remained committed to its mission of providing
                reliable, innovative, and user-centric ICT solutions. Dr. Abayomi Agbeyangi, the current ICT Unit
                Coordinator, leads a dedicated team in supporting the university's technological infrastructure and
                services. <br>

                <br> Today, the ICT Unit stands as a testament to our university's commitment to excellence and
                progress.
                With a focus on continuous improvement and staying abreast of emerging technologies, we strive to
                empower our university community with the tools and resources necessary to thrive in an increasingly
                digital world. As we look to the future, the ICT Unit remains dedicated to advancing our institution's
                mission of academic excellence, research innovation, and student success through the seamless
                integration of technology into every aspect of university life.
